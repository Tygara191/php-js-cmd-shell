# php-js-cmd-shell

What is this?

I wanted to hibernate my computer from a distance, then I decided that if I am going to make a script that lets me execute a single command, I might as well make an entire php/js shell. Then I saw the obvious and ended up only whitelisting the hibernate command anyways, but was a fun thing to do in a spare hour.
